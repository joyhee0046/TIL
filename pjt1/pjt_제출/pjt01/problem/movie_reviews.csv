666193da58a1f88965b77e41,1022789,Hotplix,"""Inside Out 2"" is a heartwarming and imaginative sequel that successfully builds on the emotional depth of its predecessor. Directed by Kelsey Mann, the film revisits Riley as she navigates the complexities of teenage life, with her emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—returning to guide her. The movie introduces new emotions, adding fresh dynamics and challenges. The animation is vibrant and expressive, capturing the nuanced portrayal of inner emotional worlds. With its clever storytelling, humor, and poignant moments, ""Inside Out 2"" resonates deeply with audiences, offering a thoughtful exploration of growing up and emotional resilience.",8.0
666fd74e159c95894aa651db,1022789,CinemaSerf,"I really quite enjoyed the first of these (2015) but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one. ""Riley"" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like ""Fear"", ""Joy"" and ""Anger"" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. ""Anger"" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic ""Ennui"" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in. It's fine, but forgettable, sorry.",6.0
667202b04234e2d0e5343999,1022789,Chris Sawin,_Inside Out 2_ is a harmless sequel that is fun for all ages but also absolutely unnecessary. The film recycles three-quarters of the original while introducing a quarter of new characters and ideas.**Full review:** https://bit.ly/PixarClone,5.0

668d477e9d1b57031f5c0507,1022789,TheSceneSnobs,"When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar’s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar’s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.I can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.The sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke’s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler’s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.The story’s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.Some interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. Amy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke’s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn’t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children’s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.Inside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.If you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley’s journey. It’s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",8.0
666193270936853b78cbb431,519182,Hotplix,"""Despicable Me 4"" is a delightful addition to the beloved animated franchise, bringing back the charm and humor that fans adore. Directed by Kyle Balda, the film sees the return of Gru, voiced by Steve Carell, and his mischievous Minions on another entertaining adventure. The movie balances heartwarming moments with laugh-out-loud comedy, introducing fresh characters and creative plot twists. The animation is vibrant and engaging, while the voice cast delivers standout performances. ""Despicable Me 4"" continues to capture the magic of the series, making it a fun and enjoyable watch for audiences of all ages.",8.0
668d480067947cfba5314de5,519182,TheSceneSnobs,"There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.One of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.The film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. While my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it’s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.If there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it’s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",6.0
669625e9ab87253c1ff3b0fa,519182,CinemaSerf,"If it's not sacrilegious to say, I think this franchise is starting to run out of steam - the plot here isn't very original. The family ""Gru"" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis ""Maxime Le Mal"" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, ""Silas"" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty ""Poppy"" knows the secret and blackmails ""Gru"" into helping her pinch ""Lenny"" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive ""Principal Übelschlecht"" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with ""Maxime"" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced ""Super Minions"" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore. It does liven up for the last ten minutes, but the previously innovative and enjoyable mix of menace and mayhem has largely gone.",6.0

In a shot he's looking all sad and bedraggled at the windows, next he's demolished the man's dinner and finally coaxed him from his comfortable flat to a new house that they share with the dog ""Odie"". His life is just one idyllic round of snoozing, eating and watching ""Catflix"" until he and ""Odie"" are kidnapped. Why? Well it's only when they are rescued by a caped hero - who turns out to be his dad ""Vic"", and we then are introduced to the criminal mastermind that is ""Jinx"" who has an axe to grind, that we start to get to the bottom things. She spent ages in the pound and is looking for her pint of milk! Now ""Garfield"", ""Odie"" and ""Vic"" have to come up with plan to rob a well defended dairy to settle scores. Even if they succeed, can they trust the duplicitous ""Jinx"" and her two sinister hench-creatures? It's an amiable enough adventure movie, this, with plenty of daft escapades for the cats, a menacing security officer and even an old lovelorn bull (""Otto"") who's seen better days. I found the story reminded me a bit of the ""Wallace and Gromit"" kind of mishap-ridden narrative and though it's probably twenty minutes too long to sustain a film that doesn't seem to ever want to end, it's got the usual messages to team-playing, family and loyalty and has some quite witty one-liners now and again.",6.0

668d4dae5a397d2c551612ed,748783,TheSceneSnobs,"The Garfield Movie is a vast improvement over the previous live-action Garfield films. Initially, I didn’t expect much, but by the end, I found myself loving this fun and adventurous film. It has a lot of heart, some good laughs, and is great for parents to take their kids to.One of the standout elements of the movie is the introduction of Garfield’s father, Vic. This addition brings a fresh perspective to the Garfield universe. The dysfunctional father-son dynamic adds depth to the story, making it more engaging. The plot cleverly intertwines this family dynamic with a heist storyline, which adds excitement and keeps the narrative moving at a brisk pace. The movie offers plenty of laughs, with jokes that appeal to both kids and adults. The humor is well-timed and varies from slapstick to witty one-liners, ensuring that there is something for everyone.Odie, in particular, stands out and truly rocks in this film. His loyal and energetic presence brings a lot of charm to the screen. The chemistry between Garfield and Odie is spot on, providing some of the film’s most memorable moments. In conclusion, The Garfield Movie is a delightful surprise and a significant step up from its predecessors. With its heartwarming story, engaging characters, and balanced humor, it’s a film that both kids and parents can enjoy together. The addition of Garfield’s father, Vic, and the dynamic he brings to the story, along with Odie’s standout moments, make this a must-watch for fans of the beloved cat. Whether you’re a long-time Garfield fan or new to his adventures, this film offers a fun and heartwarming experience that’s well worth the time.",7.0

The performances of Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne as Furiosa deserve praise, as does Chris Hemsworth's insane portrayal of Dementus.Depending on the chosen viewing order, the perspective on both films changes drastically, but in the end, they remain essential recommendations to every movie lover out there.""Rating: B+",7.0
665589aadab77cca4e1cbaea,786892,CinemaSerf,"The young ""Furiosa"" (Alyla Browne) is captured by some rogue bikers and despite the best efforts of her sharp-shooting mother is help captive by the menacing ""Dementus"" (Chris Hemsworth) who rather paternally calls her ""Little D""! This dystopian world really consists of three powers. The ""Immortan Joe"" (Lachy Hulme) in an unassailable citadel where food and water are plentiful, the ""Guardian of Gastown"" (Peter Stephens) who runs the last refinery producing petrol and the ""Bullet Farm"" - a quarry. They have a loose bartering arrangement that allows each to hold their own territory and this is arrangement ""Dementus"" and his army of thousands wants to take control of. He does manage to secure a better deal with ""Joe"" but only if he trades his ""Little D"" as part of the bargain. Once she's been duly swapped and introduced to his harem, she determines that she needs a new ID! Years go by as she passes for a boy, moves up the food chain at the Citadel and is finally sent on war-rig duties trading gas for food. It's now that she (Anya Taylor-Joy) encounters the war-rig driver ""Praeteorian Jack"" (Tom Burke) and, thinking he might be a conduit for her to get back home, joins forces for some battles royal. As origin stories go, this is good end to end stuff, quickly paced and packed with action right from the beginning. Hemsworth is highly entertaining as the prose-spouting monster and there are loads of supporting characters - the likes of ""Smeg"", ""Rictus Erectus"" and ""Scrotus"" to characterise these gangs of violent and ruthless half-wits. ATJ doesn't really have that much to do for most of this, and has virtually no dialogue - but when she is on screen she works well with her ninja skills coming to the fore. I didn't love the ending, it drags a bit and is entirely predictable, but this holds up well for 2½ hours and the stunt work and live-action photography is impressive.",7.0
6657ff72c940cfc5cd74d756,786892,MovieGuys,"Whilst Furiosa isn't a bad action film, I suspect its lacklustre response from audiences, reflects not whats on offer but whats absent. On the upside is loads of heart stopping action, amazing cinematic's, great sets, plus strong performances from the cast.A lesser aspect of the downside is the unnecessarily drawn out back story, replete with details about the key character, no one cares about, which, in turn, leads to the main fault in this film.......ITS NOT ABOUT MAD MAX Rockatansky.Lets be honest, no one's really interested in peripheral characters or their back story, they want the REAL DEAL. That's where this film was always going to fall flat with viewing audiences.If this film had been about Mad Max with a back story covering as yet unrevealed aspects of the life of  the younger and older Max, in the latter case played by the actor who made the franchise famous, Mel Gibson, then I suspect Hollywood would have a real HIT on their hands. In summary, you don't make a major film about the back story of a peripheral character from a franchise, you make the film about the MAIN character, its as simple as that. I'm amazed this wasn't obvious.",6.0
665a2464512f151cfa942911,786892,r96sk,"I enjoyed <em>'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga'</em>, which is a rightful addition to the <em>'Mad Max'</em> franchise.I personally would say that the run time is way too long, like this does not need to be a 2hr 20min+ movie. With that said, I still got the desired amount of entertainment from this 2024 flick. Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.Anya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, her character doesn't say much so a lot of the performance is reliant on her visual emotions - which Taylor-Joy portrays on point. The rest of the cast are on the same level to me, all support the show well without rising near the lead two; similar-ish story for the whole franchise, in truth.Visually the movie looks cracking, while the action matches prior installments in providing the vast majority of what makes these films so worth the watch. This prequel/spin-off is one I'd put in the top bracket from this series, it's up there with <em>'Mad Max: Fury Road'</em> - which does just slightly edge ahead.",8.0

668d4898f79d05d1ecdc3fc2,786892,TheSceneSnobs,"This installment of the Mad Max saga was disappointing. Personally, I would have preferred a continuation of Furiosa's story with Charlize Theron rather than an origin story. However, once Anya Taylor-Joy was cast, my excitement returned. Her performance in The Menu is one of my favorites, and she has never given a bad performance. Despite my anticipation, I walked out of this movie feeling underwhelmed.The film feels a bit detached from the franchise. Returning to an origin story, especially in this series, feels like a misstep. The strength of the first four movies lies in their forward momentum and the development of their characters. We've already seen the beginning in Mad Max; what the audience craves is progress, ideally with Max at the forefront but I would like to see 'Furiosa' along for future rides.While the cinematography is undeniably gorgeous, the editing leaves much to be desired. The film spends too much time on areas that don't align with what makes a Mad Max film great. For example, the original films excelled in their high-octane action sequences and tight pacing, whereas this installment meanders, losing the kinetic energy that defines the series and limits an entire war to a montage.Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of Dementus is a mixed bag. He brings a certain fun to the role, but his character often feels frustratingly inconsistent. There are moments where Dementus' choices seem out of character or simply don’t make sense, disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the overall impact of the film. Some could argue that his demented nature is the reason for his decisions but even that idea falls flat.One of the most disappointing aspects is that this movie lacks the fun, rewatchable quality of its predecessors. The previous films in the series are known for their relentless pace and compelling characters, making them enjoyable to revisit. This installment, however, doesn’t capture that same magic, leaving it feeling somewhat deflated in comparison.While 'Furiosa' offers some stunning visals and strong performances, it ultimately fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. The decision to focus on an origin story rather than continuing Furiosa's journey feels like a missed opportunity. Fans of the franchise may find some enjoyment in the film, but it doesn’t possess the same exhilarating spirit that made the earlier movies iconic.Moving forward, it would be more satisfying to see the series return to its roots, focusing on character-driven narratives that push the story forward. A continuation of Furiosa’s journey or a new chapter with Max would likely resonate more with audiences, capturing the essence of what makes Mad Max an enduring and beloved franchise.",5.0
66970ff580af88181c5671ba,786892,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"There’s no doubt that “Furiosa” is a strong, entertaining, and high quality film, but director George Miller‘s latest installment in the Mad Max franchise falls short in delivering the same fresh and original experience as “Fury Road.” Miller builds on the legacy of the 2015 Oscar-winning hit, but the film still struggles with a repetitive narrative (and a tired retread of visuals) that fails to capture the groundbreaking innovations that made its predecessor such a worldwide phenomenon. I liked this movie a lot, but I certainly didn’t love it.As the world collapses, young Furiosa (Alyla Browne) is forcibly taken from the Green Place of Many Mothers and captured by a formidable Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). As they traverse the Wasteland, they encounter the Citadel, ruled by Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). Amidst the power struggle between these two tyrants, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) must endure numerous trials to gather the resources needed to find her way back home.The film tells the origin story of the renegade warrior (and certified badass) Furiosa before her encounter with Mad Max. It’s a prequel to “Fury Road,” and this movie builds a satisfying history to the unlikely female hero. The first half of the story is the most compelling, as the narrative traces Furiosa’s journey from a young girl held captive in a brutal world to her development into a fierce combatant. The first part of her history is also filled with the most emotional depth, outlining the motivations of her character and the harsh realities that shaped her. It adds layers of complexity to the character, which is why I found this part of the movie to be the most engaging.The second half began to wear me down as it falls into a repetitive cycle of desert chases and action scenes that feel all too familiar. While they’re executed with Miller’s signature flair, they seem lacking in innovation. The whole “been there, done that” vibe really puts a damper on things. I think part of the problem here is that “Fury Road” set such a high bar with its inventive visual style and storytelling, and a lot of that is replicated (flaming fireballs, armored trucks, vast expanses of golden deserts…even some of the exact same stunts are in play). This makes the film too predictable and slightly disappointing, especially when that element of surprise and eye-popping awe has come to define the franchise. The action is a blast and the post-apocalyptic setting and costumes are exceptional, but the envelope isn’t quite pushed as far as it could’ve been.The brightest spot is, without question, Simon Duggan‘s cinematography. This is a gorgeous looking movie from beginning to end, and the visuals capture the brutality as well as the stark beauty of the wasteland. The special effects are also flawless, but all of these technical achievements (and strong performances from the cast) can’t quite compensate for the weaker elements — although I would venture to guess that diehard fans aren’t going to care.“Furiosa” is a worthy addition to the Mad Max saga, even if it doesn’t reach the creative heights nor deliver the groundbreaking experience that delighted all of us with “Fury Road.”By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",5.0

663f418fda58cf1d0fa40f99,653346,CinemaSerf,"Quick question. So it was a virus that led to the role reversal between the speaking humans and their ape counterparts? Now the apes have the upper hand and humanity is back in the caves. What I don't really get is why everything is in ruins and why there's an escalator in the middle of a forest full of zebras? Speech is crucial for communication, granted, but as the apes now thrive amidst the ruins of human construction I couldn't quite figure out why it was all decimated in the first place. Was there a war? Did I miss it? Anyway, Simian society still claims derivation from ""Caesar"" and in typical human fashion is just as divided. The apes live a peaceful life stealing the eagle's eggs from precariously perched nests so they can rear them themselves - and the eagles don't really seem to mind. The militaristic gorillas raid their village and drag them all to the seaside resort of ""Proximus"" where he is trying to break into an human, subterranean, vault. The raid caused havoc amongst the peaceable apes and left only ""Noa"" to try to free them. En route, he encounters ""Mae"" (Freya Allan) - an human who can speak, and upon arrival she befriends another talking person ""Trevathan"" (William H. Macy) who are both expected to help reach the treasures of the vault. She knows what's in there, and with the help of her new friends hopes to salvage what she was sent to retrieve - but without allowing any weapons inside to fall into enemy hands. It takes far too long to get going, this, but once we've established who is who and the story has kicked in, it's quite an exciting tale with some great visuals effects and just a little philosophy to keep it from falling into a trap of franchise mundanity. The acting isn't really up to much, but an enthusiastic effort from Kevin Durand as the menacing leader and some authentic looking acrobatics not seen since Johnny Weissmuller make for an entertaining episode in what is clearly a soap-style plot development where this is but an episode in a what happens next scenario.",7.0

This fourth installment, however, underwhelmed me throughout its 145 minute run time. It starts off a new plot, obviously given how <em>'War for the Planet of the Apes'</em> concluded, and the new characters and their stories didn't really interest me.Some of the action is watchable, the military bunker angle is decent, the visual effects are strong (but we already knew that) and the bits directly with Noa and Raka are the film's best in my opinion. I don't, though, really recall much else about this and remember feeling quite nonplussed whilst watching; the literal final music-filled shot got me pumped though, out of nowhere. None of the cast (voice or otherwise) stand out, either.I'd have finished this franchise with the 2017 flick, but very much sounds like the filmmakers are planning another trilogy with this one.

665ed96ce1aa8153791c31cf,653346,Midi-chlorian_Count,"Just seen this and thought it was a pretty good edition to the series.The CGI is now good enough for what is probably our first really in-depth look at the ape civilization following the fall of man.Sure, it doesn't have as grandiose a story as Caesar's but it does a grand job of world building and showing us how the ape society of the distant future is functioning. The exploration of the mythology which has built up with regards to their past and Caesar's time is also interesting.Proximus isn't even really a villain as such, which makes him and his vision for the future a nice counter to the uncertain goals of Noa's human companion.Particularly enjoyed the ending, which, when you realise it is coming, you have to laugh as it has been set up throughout the movie.And the little kicker was good too. Setting us up nicely for a sequel which may see this reboot series veer back towards it's origins.Definitely well worth seeing if you're a fan of the reboot series...",6.0

Its story is rather formulaic and you do quickly feel like you have ""seen it all before"", in one form or another. Having said this, I do not think Kingdom is a bad film. That would be unfair. Its CGI is top notch, as I said its story is basic but it does work, with well paced, varied action. Commendably, they even managed a little human/ape interest, which lifts the characters beyond being mere, cardboard cut outs.  In summary, entertaining, watchable but really as far as I can see, nothing new is on offer here, either. Perhaps I'm being a little harsh but it would be nice, to see some genuine originality from Hollywood. They could do it once, why not now?",6.0
668d49e22c318ef8460d1c0b,653346,TheSceneSnobs,"The Planet of the Apes prequel films have been nothing short of astonishing, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes continues this trend with remarkable filmmaking. The decision to set this installment 300 years after the previous films, yet still focus on Caesar's legacy, was a brilliant move. It effectively addresses the absence of Andy Serkis and Caesar by weaving his influence throughout the narrative.Our protagonist Noah and his clan emerge as standout characters, bringing new life to the series. Their dynamic and struggles are compelling, adding depth to the narrative. Proximus Caesar serves as an effective villain, embodying the darker aspects of Caesar's legacy. His complex motivations and ruthless tactics provide a formidable challenge for Noah and his allies. My biggest gripe with the film lies in the portrayal of the human element. There is a lack of clarity regarding humanity's current state within this franchise. More understanding or explanation of humanity's status would have enriched the story. For instance, scenes involving humans operating missile silos 300 years after their construction strain credibility without sufficient backstory. A deeper exploration of how humanity has adapted or regressed over the centuries would have added valuable context.Despite this flaw, the overall filmmaking remains top-notch. The visuals are stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in both the ape civilization and the post-apocalyptic landscapes. The special effects, particularly the motion capture work, are exceptional, bringing the apes to life with astonishing realism. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic addition to the series, successfully balancing new elements with the rich legacy of Caesar. While the human storyline could benefit from greater depth and clarity, the film excels in its primary focus on the apes and their evolving society. This installment delivers a satisfying conclusion to the saga, and I would be content if the series ended here, preserving the integrity of Caesar's legacy and the high standards set by these prequels.",7.0

6662b56f752063ec0ee97ce4,573435,CinemaSerf,"I'd completely forgotten about ""Bad Boys for Life"" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that ""Mike"" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn't know about - ""Armando"" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner ""Marcus"" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, ""Mike"" has just got married; ""Marcus"" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved ""Capt. Howard"" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of ""Mike"" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. ""Howard"" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated ""Armando"" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.",7.0

The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.Still, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.I will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.Do we need a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? No. Would I watch a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? Yes. Yes I would.",7.0
668d4945ca5e4a6125f27908,573435,TheSceneSnobs,"I didn’t know what to expect going into the fourth installment of one of my favorite buddy cop franchises. Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.This film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.The film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn’t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.One concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.The heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.Overall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film’s core strengths—its characters and story—remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you’ll likely find much to enjoy here. The film strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, ensuring that both longtime fans and new viewers can appreciate its charms.",7.0

The downsides, in short order, include a rapper gangsta vibe, that's overcooked to the point of cultural cremation. Its no helped by humour, that's, for most of this film, rarely even remotely funny. The upside is what you would expect, polished and unrelentingly, over the top action, which, taken on its own, is entertaining.

669710edf5cd892aab15b2d1,573435,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"I had an absolute blast watching “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” the fourth installment in the popular buddy comedy / action franchise that started off with a bang way back in 1995. Co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, back at the helm after 2020’s “Bad Boys for Life,” pay homage to the “Bad Boys” legacy while injecting new life into it. As a longtime fan, this film actually over delivers. It is everything I wanted and more. I feel like the word-of-mouth on this movie is going to be electric and if audiences decide to show up, it very well could be the movie that saves the summer box office.When their former Captain and friend Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is implicated in a corruption scandal involving a dangerous cartel, Miami police officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) have to work to clear his name. After a series of unexpected events, the partners find themselves on the other end of the law. Now on the run as wanted criminals (and on a hit list of local gangs), Mike and Marcus must stay ahead of the cops and the cartel while rushing to solve the mystery of who wants to frame the late Captain Howard. With danger closing in and not knowing who to trust, the men must rely on their wits, their friendship, and their street-smart instincts to survive.There is a lot that works well here, starting with a strong story where the stakes are high, the danger feels real, and the villain is formidable. The plot, which isn’t loaded with silly twists and turns, is actually plausible. It’s a rare combination in what could’ve been just another mindless summer blockbuster, and there’s a lot more meat on the bones, narrative-wise. The film also rekindles a love for what I now consider modern iconic characters. Marcus and Mike may be older, but their banter, camaraderie, and comedic timing all still feel relevant. Most of this is due to Smith and Lawrence being a terrific pair, bickering with a natural chemistry that comes across as effortless. You believe these two guys would give their lives for each other, which makes the story even stronger. It is such a pleasure to see these two back together again.The R-rated action is among the best of the franchise, too, from high-speed chases to intense, bloody shootouts. There are a series of inventive scenes that are expertly choreographed and storyboarded, and it’s been a while since I’ve seen such fresh and original action sequences like the ones here. The creativity sets (and hits) a higher bar, and El Arbi and Fallah’s contemporary directorial approach is stylish, energetic, and results in adrenaline-fueled action scenes that are so well done that the film is a literal heart pounder. This is one of those stand up and cheer type of films that’s best experienced with an audience that’s also fired up to be there.I absolutely loved everything about “Bad Boys: Ride or Die.” It’s the type of action film that’s done so well, you’ll leave the theater feeling that overwhelming sense of exhilaration that can only be described as a Hollywood high. If you love the genre, make it a priority to go see this one.By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",9.0
668c6ebbe11fa489139cc3a7,280180,MovieGuys,"Beverly Hills Flop Broken Axel is yet another attempt to cash in on a veteran franchise, that simply doesn't work. Whilst all the trapping are there, including Eddie Murphy, who has aged well, much else hasn't. The cheeky, outlandish antics of the original films, is replaced with the usual woke(DEI) hand wringing, whinging and whining. The daughter character, in particular, is intensely irritating. She takes empowerment and daddy issues, to a sour faced, new level, dampening down any sense of humour and fun, that could have been derived from this film. And that's essentially what the Beverly Hills Cop films from the 80's were, action mixed with zany, out there comedy, that showcased Murphy's quick fire intellect and wit. A lighter version, of the Lethal Weapon series, from the same era but much in the same vein. Certainly not a back drop, for heavy handed, biased, social moralising.In summary, Eddie Murphy is as likeable as ever but so much else about this film isn't, its hard to say nice things. The incessant need to push ""the message"" takes something that should be fun and lighthearted and buries it beneath heavy morose layers of lecturing. My advice, watch the original films instead.",5.0
668d4c7f7a10824ed8f2792f,280180,TheSceneSnobs,"To say that I was excited for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is an understatement. This is without a doubt one of my favorite franchises of all time, even including the less impressive third film. I thoroughly enjoyed this fourth installment, which sees an older Axel Foley back in Beverly Hills working a case. This time, he is up against cartels, corrupt cops, and more, led by Kevin Bacon, who threatens his daughter Jane, a Beverly Hills defense attorney.In this film, Axel teams up with a young detective, Bobby, who is also Jane’s ex-boyfriend, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The return of franchise favorites Judge Reinhold as Billy Rosewood, John Ashton as John Taggert, Bronson Pinchot as Serge, and Paul Reiser as Jeffrey adds a layer of nostalgia that fans will appreciate.Eddie Murphy effortlessly slips back into the character of Axel Foley, as easily as putting on his Lions varsity jacket. His performance is both charismatic and energetic, reminding us why this character became an icon. Murphy’s ability to blend humor with action is on full display, particularly in scenes where he outsmarts his adversaries with his trademark wit and cunning.The story is fun and packed with exciting moments, and it also has a surprising amount of heart. The chemistry between the original cast members remains perfect and mixes well with the new additions. Kevin Bacon shines as a formidable antagonist, providing a worthy challenge for Axel and his team. His portrayal of a corrupt, menacing figure adds depth to the film’s conflict.The cinematography successfully bridges the gritty feel of the first movies with the more stylistic approach of the second. The action sequences are well-executed, although some of the stunts and gags feel a bit over the top. For example, an elaborate chase scene through the streets of Beverly Hills, while thrilling, stretches the bounds of believability. Additionally, the film’s timeline contains some questionable elements that don’t quite align with the previous entries in the series. These inconsistencies, while minor, can be distracting for long-time fans.I appreciated the film’s attempt to incorporate elements from the earlier movies, but I wish Beverly Hills Cop 3 had been integrated more thoughtfully rather than just as a throwaway joke. A more substantial nod to the third film could have added a layer of continuity and depth to the story.Overall, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a fun action film that fits well with the recent trend of entertaining action movies released this year. It’s impressive how the film manages to capture the spirit of the original while adding fresh elements to keep the story engaging. Eddie Murphy’s return as Axel Foley is a delight, and the film’s blend of humor, action, and heart makes it a worthy addition to the franchise. Despite some minor flaws, this movie stands out as a testament to why the Beverly Hills Cop series remains beloved by fans.",8.0

6697fab7943a13b456aa0023,280180,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” revisits the popular franchise with the expected heavy dose of nostalgia, and thankfully Eddie Murphy‘s enduring charm overpowers the uninspired screenwriting and lackluster storyline. Filled with callbacks, familiar faces, and the iconic soundtrack that defined the 80s, this comfortable journey back to the streets of Beverly hills with the Detroit detective feels tailor-made for fans of the series.Irreverent detective Axel Foley (Murphy) is back on the beat in the 90210 after his attorney daughter Jane’s (Taylour Paige) life is threatened. A lot of very powerful people want her to back off a case involving some very dirty cops, and she reluctantly works with her estranged dad to get to the bottom of all the threats. Axel teams up with a new local “partner” (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old pals Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) for help uncovering what turns out to be a big conspiracy.It’s a formulaic and predictable plot that still serves as a solid framework for a classic crime story. Murphy effortlessly slips back into Foley’s shoes, delivering the wisecracks with that million dollar charisma that made the character a fan favorite (and himself a certified movie star). It’s fun to see Reinhold and Ashton in action again, but they are mostly there to serve up some additional ‘memberberries. Cast additions Paige and Gordon-Levitt inject some fresh energy into the mix, which, despite their characters both feeling underdeveloped, is more than welcome.The film takes the nostalgia to the next level, including the overuse of the franchise’s best-selling soundtracks. There are three classic tunes in the opening ten minutes, which feels like a gimmick to get viewers settled into a certain mindset. It works, because this trip through familiar territory is one that relies heavily on the ability of its audience to “just go with it.” Director Mark Molloy delivers what fans expect, from serviceable action sequences, lighthearted humor, and a safe formula that is far from groundbreaking (because it doesn’t need to be).“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” is a good enough nostalgia-filled reunion with Murphy’s iconic character. It’s ultimately forgettable, but still provides an enjoyable ride for those looking to revisit old friends and relive the magic of the original films.By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",5.0
661038d6b97442016fc823de,560016,r96sk,"Slightly too long, but pretty much every other element of <em>'Monkey Man'</em> is more than enough to compensate.I had a very good time watching what is Dev Patel's directorial debut. He himself is outstanding, having portrayed the role of the titular character perfectly. I had only seen the guy in two films (<em>'Slumdog Millionaire'</em> & <em>'The Last Airbender'</em>) prior to this, so very much happy to see him act further. An excellent job from him on and off screen, I'm happy that he managed to get this made in the end.As noted, I do think the run time could've been trimmed a little. It's not a major issue of mine, at all, but at a few moments I did feel my interest wane a bit. The story itself is a good one though, one that is entwined with a lot of fight (literally) but a lot of feeling too. Visually, it's a beauty.

66169c54c7a7e0017d06a0ed,560016,CinemaSerf,"Dev Patel has spoken a lot about him not wanting to be ""James Bond"" but it looks like those stories have inspired quite a bit of this pretty derivative revenge thriller that actually reminded me a bit of his ""Hotel Mumbai"" (2018) outing too. We know that he (""Kid"") routinely dons a monkey mask for some wrestling and he duly gets a pasting - but that this all has purpose. That purpose starts to come together when he manages to organise a subtle sting operation on ""Queenie"" (Ashwini Kalsekar) who runs an high-end gentleman's club. His reward here is a job. In the kitchens, bleaching the toilets and washing the pots. A means to an end though as he befriends the drug-pusher ""Alphonso"" (Pitobash) - who has a nifty, turbo-charged, tuk-tuk, and is soon elevated to the rank of waiter to the corrupt and profligate of city society who frequent the place. Interspersed with his burgeoning career, we begin to see flashbacks of his childhood - and of the brutality that reduced him to his present, vengeful, circumstances. The story is set against a backdrop of political turmoil and with an election looming, he becomes aware that there are wheels within wheels and that his principle antagonist is firmly amongst the secular and religious plotters. He also finds himself being cared for by a sagely monk ""Alpha"" (Vipin Sharma) who helps him to focus both his mind and his body as we build to a denouement that can be seen from space by anyone who's ever seen a ""John Wick"" film. Patel is a charismatic man but that's not what's needed here. That's something just a little more original to keep this over-long two hours from becoming just a bit dull and procedural. It's not terrible, but it's not really up to much either.",6.0
662e3d2fc3aa3f012bfd5b5d,560016,cleverashu,"There's a recurrent metaphor throughout the film, of Hanuman trying to eat the sun leaping towards it Icarus-like and being stopped by the gods eventually. Maybe Dev Patel was aware of how well this metaphor would encapsulate his brave directorial debut too, all throughout the film he's trying to reach the narrative he wants to tell but he eventually pulls his own punches. Only if he knew his film would eventually not release in Indian theaters at all, howmuchever he restrains himself.Don't get me wrong, this is a highly enjoyable film. But the commentary on the current Indian society and what is plaguing it and all the classist and casteist divides we have setup within ourselves -- all of that comes out a tad bit feeble and a bit too watered-down.You can see Dev touching majorly on religious blind-faith intermingling with politics, but also offhandedly on caste and patriarchy too -- there's even a montage of real-life videos of a few of these evils thrown in for good measure -- but everything is a bit too sanitised and it doesn't jolt you. Not for a single moment did the film drown me in itself with these thoughts, always swimming on the surface. Water and fire are another recurrent tropes which occur throughout, another piece of foresight by Dev on how his fire would eventually be watered and we would just swim on the surface of it.Having said that all out, I completely dig the film for its action and how it tries to mix Indian music and instruments throughout. **There's Zakir Hussain in it ffs, now THAT is what true cameos should be like, completely unexpected and swooping you in.** I've always liked Dev's performance and here he proves he's as good behind the camera as he is on it. It was great to see familiar Indian faces as well. There's also one homage to _Ghajini_ in there which I feel was a great nod.One last piece of critique and then I would leave: the fictional cities and villages all feel lived-in and real, but at the same time a little bit Westernised too to be uniquely identified as Indian.",7.0
668d5de1e440204440d586f8,560016,TheSceneSnobs,"When I saw the trailer for Monkey Man, I was unsure of what to expect. It seemed like a standard revenge tale with a horror twist. However, what I got was one of my favorite films of the year. Dev Patel shines not only in his acting but also in his directing. This film is much more than another John Wick type of movie; it delves into deep themes and presents a complex narrative that I thoroughly enjoyed.Initially, the trailer gave the impression of a conventional revenge story with some horror elements. However, the film exceeds these expectations by offering a richer, more nuanced narrative. The themes explored are profound, touching on revenge, justice, and the human condition. Dev Patel's dual role as actor and director is impressive. His performance is both intense and layered, bringing depth to his character's journey. Additionally, his direction is sharp, balancing action with moments of introspection.The film is more than just an action-packed revenge story; it explores deeper themes that resonate on multiple levels. The narrative examines the nature of revenge and its impact on the individual and society. For example, the protagonist's quest isn't just about personal vendetta but also about addressing the broader corruption and injustice in the city. This thematic depth sets the film apart from more straightforward action movies.My biggest gripe is that the story could benefit from a longer runtime (which I NEVER say). The film occasionally feels rushed, particularly in the latter half when the protagonist begins his hunt. More time to build tension and develop interactions would enhance the overall impact. Despite this minor flaw, the movie is fantastic. It stands out for its strong performances, thoughtful direction, and complex narrative. Dev Patel has proven himself as a talented filmmaker capable of delivering both action and substance. I look forward to seeing more from him in the future and hope he continues to explore and expand on these rich themes.",8.0
66970fb5f8968465131889b7,560016,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"Fans of elevated revenge action films are going to be flat-out dazzled by “Monkey Man,” the directorial debut of Dev Patel (who also co-wrote and stars as the titular character). Many actors are unsuccessful when attempting to make the transition from in front of the camera to behind it, but Patel has the talent to back it up tenfold. This story of vengeance is done so well that I have very few criticisms. It exceeds expectations in all respects.The anonymous Kid (Patel) makes a living by sparring for cash in a seedy underground fight club. His gimmick includes wearing a gorilla mask and agreeing to take the fall to his more popular opponents. After enduring bloody beatings for years while carrying with him a terrible childhood trauma, Kid’s rage has grown to astronomical levels. When he discovers a way to infiltrate the city’s elaborate network of corrupt leaders who are responsible for his mother’s death, Kid makes it his personal mission to exact revenge. In the process, he becomes a savior of the people, an underdog who helps the powerless settle the score and right the wrongs that they’ve all endured at the hands of the elite.It’s a simple story that works well for a revenge film, as Kid has a great motivation for unleashing his violent retribution. This makes him a hero you want to root for. He’s a murderer, but the people he kills most certainly had it coming. Patel (along with co-writers Paul Angunawela and John Collee) include culturally-appropriate thematic elements that make a statement on the current political climate in India, which lends a depth to the story that makes it as meaningful as it is entertaining.Heavily influenced by “The Raid,” “John Wick,” and Korean cinema, eagle-eyed viewers will catch many references and homages to these films. Thankfully, Patel’s approach doesn’t feel like a sad imitation of similar revenge action movies. The production values are fantastic, and every element falls into place. Patel has a great visual style that feels like he’s approaching his direction as a fan who understands the language of cinema (particularly action). There is some really creative stuff here, from the inventive kills to the exciting stunts.The fight choreography is nothing short of excellent, and the realistic makeup and stunt coordination combine to make the hand-to-hand brawls feel so authentic The sets and creative duels are absolutely terrific, and fans of the genre will not be disappointed.The film has its share of violent, bloody mayhem, but it’s not as action-packed as you may be led to believe. There is a lot of story, but it’s a strong one. The fighting doesn’t start until a good 40 minutes into the film, so it’s a good thing that the dramatic elements work so well (the narrative lags briefly about halfway through, however).The biggest surprise to come out of the film is that Patel actually has the talent to back up everything he attempts, from the stunt work (which resulted in multiple personal injuries), writing, direction, and acting. Lanky and thin, he’s an atypical action star, but he sells it here as a scrappy yet powerful fighter who is dismissed as “a kid from the gutter.” You will cheer when Kid embarks on his savage rampage of revenge, especially when this nobody eventually becomes a somebody. Turns out, Patel is a badass action star with an undeniable charm, which makes for a magic combination.“Monkey Man” strikes the right balance between meaningful political commentary and full-speed fun, and Patel does both equally well. Topped off with its stylish, gritty atmosphere and high-energy action, this is the type of film that will get you energized about the genre.By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",8.0

Unbeknown to him, though, we know that the studio set is home to a malevolent spirit - who saw off his predecessor (or perhaps he just volunteered) - and is now determined to cause more mischief. Luckily, director ""Peter"" (Adam Goldberg) has engaged the services of a real priest (David Hyde Pierce) to authenticate the clerical aspects of the film as ""Anthony"" and co-star ""Joe"" (Sam Worthington) find their efforts constantly disrupted by his increasingly vivid dreams, lots of bursting light bulbs and the tiniest bit of Satanic body-bopping. There's really nothing at all to recommend this to anyone. It's not original, nor is it funny.

More Hollow Earth, more Titans, more gloriously giant fights filled with fantastic visual effects… and much more nonsense too.Through an openly absurd narrative, Adam Wingard takes the charm and chemistry of his cast to help focus the film’s main spotlight on the titanic protagonists, Godzilla and Kong, delivering two hours of pure, unadulterated entertainment.It won’t convert the most skeptical, but it will certainly solidify the unashamed passion of MonsterVerse fans.""Rating: B",7.0
660e8ae9149565017dbd77e1,823464,CinemaSerf,"It has to get at least three stars because it's got Dan Stevens (and his piercing eyes) in it. Otherwise, this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination. A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with ""Kong"" ruling the roost deep in ""Hollow Earth""; ""Godzilla"" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and ""Ilene"" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled ""Jia"" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for ""Monarch"" and mankind. ""Kong"" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, ""Trapper"" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. ""Godzilla"" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by ""Kong"" and his human pals. With ""Bernie"" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why ""Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times ""Kong"" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from ""Jurassic Park"" to episodes of ""Stargate"". It does need a big screen, though. On television it will be even more forgettable - but I did like the moth.",6.0
66186e3cbbcae0017c949ee9,823464,r96sk,"A whole load of nothing!<em>'Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire'</em> is not a good movie, in my opinion anyway. It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.The needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.The whole film feels like if <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/avatar-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Avatar</a>'</em> and the <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/planet-of-the-apes-reboot-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Planet of the Apes</a>'</em> reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.Cast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.My review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.Catching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the 'proper' Godzilla releases out of Japan, so there is that.

Unlike Godzilla minus One, this Hollywood affair fails to deliver beyond the superficial. Its back story, sprinkled with the usual woke fluff, is formulaic, unimaginative and frankly, a little lazy.

I've got no problem with human drama in movies like this when it's done right, or at least engaging. Monarch was engaging. For the main human characters here, this only ever gets engaging at the very end.I'm beginning to think the problem here is that movies like this are no longer ""movies"", they're ""installments"". They don't feel like self-contained polished products anymore, they feel like filler episodes filled with smaller barely connected filler episodes. Godzilla x Kong is like the opening to Age of Ultron, except it's the majority of the movie. You just don't really feel grounded at all.There's too much music. They try to recapture the ""magic"" of the intro and ending of Godzilla vs Kong but it fails spectacularly. It was cute there because the focus was on Kong and they didn't overdo it.

668d4a364e1c831f4a2c2975,823464,TheSceneSnobs,"The Monsterverse is headed in a fun direction with its 'Titans', more famously known as Godzilla and Kong. However, while the action and spectacle continue to impress, the human element of these movies has significantly declined with this latest installment.My hope is that the great character-building seen in the Monarch series can catch up to the movies. The human characters in this movie feel underdeveloped and somewhat sidelined, which detracts from the overall narrative. Despite these shortcomings, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is an action-packed and fun addition to the Kaiju subgenre. The introduction of new Titans, Skar and Shimo, provides a fresh and exciting rivalry for our iconic heroes. Their dynamic interactions and epic battles are thrilling to watch. Adam Wingard's direction effectively channels the spirit of the Showa Era Godzilla films, blending it with an 80s aesthetic and a futuristic vibe. This stylistic choice creates a unique and visually appealing backdrop for the film. The film also explores themes of rivalry, survival, and the balance of power, although these are primarily conveyed through the Titans' interactions rather than the human characters. The tone is a mix of nostalgic homage and modern spectacle, aiming to please long-time fans and newcomers alike. For example, scenes where Godzilla and Kong reluctantly team up against a common foe evoke a sense of epic camaraderie and respect, reminiscent of classic monster team-ups.Overall, while Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire excels in delivering thrilling action and visual spectacle, it falls short in human character development. The new Titans, Skar and Shimo, are exciting additions that enrich the kaiju universe. Adam Wingard's direction brings a nostalgic yet fresh aesthetic to the film. If future installments can balance the monster action with stronger human elements, the Monsterverse will continue to be a captivating franchise. This movie is a must-watch for fans of the genre, promising an entertaining and visually stunning experience.",6.0

661a45ac5ff34e014958b3c5,929590,CinemaSerf,"Nope, sorry, this just didn't work for me. It appears that there is a civil war amongst these United States. California and Texas have seceded from the Union and Florida seems to be having a wobble too. The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they've nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist ""Lee"" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort ""Joel"" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate ""Sammy"" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer ""Jessie"" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It's that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn't vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his ""always take fuel when you can"" or ""this way only leads to death"" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there's hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue ""Press"" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it's all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up. It's bitty, episodic, unrealistic and populated with characters in whom I simply could not believe. Sure, maybe it's supposed to be outlandishly apocalyptic, but it reminded me for the most part of an episode of ""Falling Skies"" - only without the aliens. Perhaps it might resonate better with an American audience? I'm not one of them and this didn't.",6.0
661c0d40cb5c8e0186759569,929590,Brent Marchant,"Cautionary tales often have some of the most significant impact when brought to life on the big screen, and that’s certainly the case with the latest offering from writer-director Alex Garland. The filmmaker’s gripping tale of a quartet of journalists (Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny) covering a civil war in a dystopian version of America of the near future follows the reporters as they make their way from New York to Washington via a circuitous route that shows them all sides of this nightmarish scenario. Essentially a road trip film, “Civil War” provides the principals and viewers with an array of images and situations graphically depicting what’s left of the US as a distraught population attempts to make sense of the circumstances and find ways to survive. The purpose of the protagonists’ journey is to secure an interview (likely the last one) with a corrupt, egomaniacal President (Nick Offerman) as rebel forces close in on the capital. They set out on this treacherous odyssey despite the dangers involved both in making the trip and in their roles as journalists, who are looked on with suspicion and have been accused of fanning the flames of the hostilities. While some have complained that the film doesn’t provide enough social and political background about the conflict, I submit that this consideration is fundamentally unnecessary: Garland is making an unadulterated statement here that, when the bullets start flying, ideology won’t matter and no one will care, a point driven home with chilling clarity over and over. The madness that consumes the population is all that’s important at that juncture, one driven by bald-faced hostility on steroids both among the combatants and the overzealousness of the reporters in seeking to “get the story,” no matter what. In achieving this end, the filmmaker holds nothing back, making this an often-difficult watch, one definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. But the picture’s message is one of grave importance, especially in today’s trying, polarized climate. We’d be wise to pay attention to what’s being said in this important work, handily the best – and most troubling – release of 2024 thus far.",8.0

Through a series of small scenes, the director seeks to compose a portrait of these professionals' actions on the battlefield without declaring the reasons for the war or identifying the sides involved.Each scene, individually, is well-executed, standing out for the quality of cinematography and an immersive sound work that amplifies the tension. However, these scenes, although effective individually, fail to come together cohesively. The result is a film that seems less than the sum of its parts. The main problem with the film is a lack of depth.Although technically well-produced, particularly in terms of audio, the film falls short of a deeper approach, which could have elevated it from a mere display of impactful scenes to a truly impactful work.",7.0

That does not really leave a lot, for the viewer, to take away from this film. A film which should have a lot to say but is, instead, conspicuously silent. Perhaps this is a reaction to the climate of division and fear that exists in the USA today? That said, why make a film about something contentious, if you have nothing contentious to say?In summary, this film really needed to be more opinionated, even if that means offering up opposing perspectives.

The juxtaposition of familiar, everyday settings with the terror of internal conflict adds a layer of realism that intensifies the horror.

6661353b8345e2cf91adcd34,1001311,MovieGuys,"Under Paris is rather ridiculous French Jaws wannabe. Whilst this production is loaded down with the predictable woke tropes I've come to expect from Netflix productions, what really caught my attention was how idiotically implausible the story is. In the opening scene a group of male divers is tasked with investigating predation at a oceanic rubbish site, that's ensnared dolphins and other dead, sea life.  Sharks soon turn up leading to the presence of a  female shark, the scientific group have been monitoring.Inexplicably the shark has essentially doubled in size, leading their all knowing female boss to ask the divers to take ""a sample"" from the monster for study, rather than following the sane and reasonable path of fleeing in terror. Predictably, the shark doesn't take this treatment too well and eats the divers. At this point our intrepid female lead having just witnessed the horrific attacks on her research ships monitors, dives into the water, to confront the monster with a spear gun, that would hardly scare a large Tuna. Without spoiling things for those who want to watch this, it doesn't get any better from here on in. Really if you are going to make a film of this kind, is it truly that hard to make it, at least, a little believable? The acting is alright, as are the action sequences but the sense of ""terror"" found in Jaws is largely absent. The key ingredient that drives, what is essentially a monster movie, forward. In summary, sinks beneath its own unbelievable story and  bland exposition. If you really want a oceanic monster film, try Jaws instead.",5.0
6697fa61bea5a0b9a97f117e,1001311,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"Diving headfirst into the genre with all the enthusiasm fans could hope for, the horror / disaster film “Under Paris” is sometimes campy and often ridiculous, but also stands out as a solid entry in the niche of killer shark flicks. It may not be a great film by conventional standards, but this one is not going to disappoint with its willingness to take the premise everywhere fans of creature feature cinema will want it to go.Set in current day, the city of Paris is getting ready to host the World Triathlon Championships on the Seine. They’re expecting a large number of athletes to compete by swimming in the famous river, but there’s a big, big problem. Sophia (Bérénice Bejo), a brilliant marine scientist with a tragic past, learns from environmental activist Mika (Léa Léviant) that there is a large shark living deep in the river. In order to avoid a literal bloodbath, they join forces with the Seine river police commander Adil (Nassim Lyes) to stop the potential carnage.It’s actually a pretty great premise, even if the science behind the narrative is (mostly) laughably implausible. While entertaining, the story gets bogged down under its over-the-top ecological messaging. The film is preachy about global warming and how humans are the real enemy, so much so that it can sometimes feel like it’s a project sponsored by Greenpeace. But there’s something admirable about director Xavier Gens‘ commitment to his message, and it adds a layer of sincerity to what is a creatively dumb premise.The movie strikes a nice balance between classic horror and a disaster story, bridging the two in a satisfying way. It has its dumb B-movie moments (including corny, stating-the-obvious dialogue like “There are sharks in Paris!“), but Gens avoids the outright stupidity of franchises like “Sharknado.” It’s absurd, but also delivers plenty of suspense and thrills.The action scenes are a mixed bag, with effects that feel very low budget. There’s a goofy shark fin that sticks out of and races through the river, and murky underwater shots dilute much of the action. But there are also bloody, gruesome shark attacks that seem very realistic, and the makeup department has created horrific images straight out of a nightmare.If you can stick with the slower parts of “Under Paris,” you’re going to be rewarded with a surprisingly great ending. Dumb yet creative, preachy yet thrilling, the movie takes its outlandish premise to all the places that fans of the genre will appreciate.By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",5.0

Her parents decide they need to move to (a rather drab) house in San Francisco, though, and as you might expect this causes some new tensions, especially as their furniture seems to have been lost in transit! Inside her pretty little head, we see her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness personified and vying for control of her personality during this lively time. Joy seems most adept at managing the situation and keeping things on an even keel, but after an inadvertent intervention from sadness, the two find themselves expelled from the control room and having to make their way back from deep within her memories before it all comes crashing down at the hands of those less optimistic sensations left in charge! It's almost as if there is an ""X-Factor"" judging panel inside everyone's head making decisions and discussing with each other which of their traits ought to prevail as circumstances dictate - and in the main it works well. It ultimately serves to advise that none of these emotions can exist in isolation and that we must learn to take the rough with the smooth, the good with the not so good. The animation is entertaining, some humour amongst the more thought-provoking stuff; a proper ""train of thought"" and a childhood friend ""Bing Bong"" whose role in her life is fading as she grows up.
